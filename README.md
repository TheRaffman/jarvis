My implementation of Iron man's faithful personal assistant.

To get started rename the `.example_env` file to `.env` and change values to your own settings.

To install all required Python packages run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

This is a work in progress, check back soon!

This is a collaboration between TheRaffman and Belogix.
